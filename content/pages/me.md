My name is Tania. I’m a developer, designer, writer, and former chef from Chicago. I currently work as a front end software engineer for [DAIS](https://www.dais.com/). I also write for [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/taniarascia), [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/author/trascia/), [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/authors/tania-rascia), [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/author/taniarascia/), [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/@taniarascia),  and other [publications](/publications).

A few highlights:

- The [Beginner’s Guide to React](/getting-started-with-react/), included in the official [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#react-for-beginners)
- The [How to Code in JavaScript](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-javascript)/[the DOM](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/understanding-the-dom-document-object-model) tutorial series on DigitalOcean
- The definitive guide to [Developing a WordPress Theme](/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) from scratch

I started this website as a place to document everything I learned while transitioning from chef to developer. I’ve continued throughout my career and the free resources I create help thousands of people successfully become developers. I turn down every ad, affiliate, and sponsor request I get. Please consider [supporting me with a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/taniarascia). (I might use it towards beer.)
