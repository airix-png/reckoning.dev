Hi, I'm Sadanand Singh. I build AI models in medical imaging and enjoy working with Algorithms,
Python/C++, and medical and biological data. My background is in computational physics, numerical
modeling and optimization and software design. I have a PhD in computational physics/chemical
engineering focusing on computational models of nano-materials and bio-molecules.

![About me](../images/about.jpg)

My active area of research is in applications of deep learning and computer vision in medical
imaging and business . I am specifically interested in designing AI models that are explainable and
tractable.

I also have huge interest in computers and programming since childhood. Apart from scientific
programming in C/C++/Python, these days I am learning a lot about javascript, gatsby, react and
databases.
