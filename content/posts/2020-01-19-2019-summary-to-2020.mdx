And it's that time of year again! Most of you must have started planning for a brand new year
and a new decade. Keeping up with that spirit, this post is about my plans and expectations
regarding this blog space for the upcoming new year.

Its been almost 5 years since I started this blog. Those of you who have been following me here,
would be aware, this has not been easy to follow at all. With frequent changes in the design,
theme, web address (from github pages to datasciencevision.com to current reckoning.dev!) and
underlying technological changes ([pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to
[nikola](https://getnikola.com/) to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to
[gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)!). The very first promise I want to make in the 2020 is to
guarantee the stability of this space.

- reckoning.dev address is going to stay for long, its been paid for the next 5 years!
- the current looks/theme (thanks to the work of [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/))
  along with the underlying tech of gatsby and react is something I have fallen in love with.

### 2019: A Brief Summary

A year is a long time. Still, when I look at my blogging history, this has been the year with the
least number of posts. Unfortunately - or fortunately - I'm learning so much, so fast, that I
haven't been able to write about it all. But at least I can track it here, and try my best to get a
resource out into the world for my own reference and to help others.

I will start with the top 5 things that I learnt this year:

- javascript, react, gatsby, css etc.
- mlflow for managing deep learning experiments
- mixed precision training in pytorch
- user-defined pytorch modules in CUDA
- sa
