I have documented my setup for [linux machines before](/mydlsetup) before. However, lately I have
been working a lot on my MacBook Pro. In this post, I want to document my setup for my macbook for
my own future needs. I am always curious to see how other software developers are setting up their
development machines so I figured it would be a good opportunity to share mine.

I am a research scientist in AI/Deep Learning and do some software development using Javascript,
markdown, etc., so most of my configuration will be around programming. My current MacBook
configuration is as follows:

- 16 inch MacBook Pro 2019
- Processor: 2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7
- Memory: 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4
- Disk: SSD 500 GB
- Graphics: AMD Radeon Pro 5300M

After getting a new Machine, first thing I do is re-install the OS with case-sensitive APFS disk,
since by default it comes installed on a Case-insensitive APFS disk type. This can be done by
rebooting the laptop with CMD+R pressed. Once it boots, use Disk Utility to reformat disk to
the case-sensitive APFS format. Then re-install the OS that the laptop came with. Once the installation
has finished, we can continue with the setup as usual.

I usually configure anything I can here like Wi-fi & Apple ID. The rest of the instructions will
assume you made it through the setup and are on the desktop. Do not forget to select disk encryption
via FileVault during this phase of the setup.

Now, please update your OS via System Preferences.
