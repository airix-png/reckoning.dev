Today, I share one of my favorite dishes - _Aloo Paratha_. It is a dish
of mashed potato stuffed bread from the Northern India. It is my
favorite breakfast dish when I am in India.

Here is my try in making some edible _parathas_. It might take few
trials in making a perfectly round-shaped _Paratha_. Please share your
views and inputs in comments below.
